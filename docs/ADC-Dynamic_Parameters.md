## Dynamic Parameters

ADC's dynamic parameters contain:

- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
- Signal to Noise and Distortion Ratio (SINAD)
- Inter-modulation Error (IM)

### Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)

**Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)** of an ADC is defined as the ratio of the Measured Signal Power's RMS (excluding Harmonic Distortion) to the Noise Power's RMS:

$$
SNR(dB)=20log(\frac{V_{SignalRMS}}{V_{NoiseRMS}})
$$

Since SNR is an ratio of power, $20$ in the equation means the square of the ratio of voltage.
