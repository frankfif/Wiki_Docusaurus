## Dynamic Parameters

ADC's dynamic parameters contain:

- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
- Signal to Noise and Distortion Ratio (SINAD)
- Inter-modulation Error (IM)

### Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)

**Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)** of an ADC is defined as the ratio of the Measured Signal Power's RMS (excluding Harmonic Distortion) to the Noise Power's RMS:

$$
SNR(dB)=20log(\frac{V_{Signal(RMS)}}{V_{Noise(RMS)}})
$$

Since SNR is an ratio of power, $20$ in the equation means the square of the ratio of voltage.

Although the Harmonic Distortion is not included in the measurement of SNR, but the Quantization, Thermal and other residual noise in converter are included.

### Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)

**Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)** of an ADC is defined as the ratio of the fundamental to all the harmonic distortion:


$$
THD(dB)=20log(\frac{\sqrt{V^2_{2(RMS)}+V^2_{3(RMS)}+...+V^2_{n(RMS)}}}{V_{1(RMS)}}
$$
