## Continuity Test (Open/Short)

Continuity test is to confirm the electronical contact between tester and DUT, and whether if short-circuit existed to other pins or to ground.

### Test Method

Continuity test is performed with protection diodes (to VDD and to GND). Usually use PPMU method with VBT code (also can be tested using PE and functional pattern).

**Method**:   

**Reasons for not passing**: 

## Power Pin Short Test

Method: using PPMU with VBT
