## Continuity Test (Open/Short)

Continuity test is to confirm the electronical contact between tester and DUT, and whether if short-circuit existed to other pins or to ground.

### Test Method

Continuity test is performed with protection diodes (to VDD and to GND). Usually use PPMU method with VBT code (also can be tested using PE and functional pattern).

#### Test through GND protection diode

1. Force 0V to all other pins that are not tested (include power pin).
2. Force a small negative current (-100uA) on the Pin Under Test. (with voltage clamp)
3. Meaure voltage on the Pin Under Testï¼š
   - Higher than max spec(>-0.2V): **Fail(Short)**
   - Midband(-1.5V~-0.2V): **Pass**
   - Lower than min spec(<-1.5V): **Fail(Open)**

#### Test through VDD protection diode

1. Force 0V to all other pins that are not tested (include power pin).
2. Force a small positive current (+100uA) on the Pin Under Test. (with voltage clamp)
3. Meaure voltage on the Pin Under Testï¼š
   - Higher than max spec(>1.5V): **Fail(Short)**
   - Midband(0.2V~1.5V): **Pass**
   - Lower than min spec(<0.2V): **Fail(Open)**

## Power Pin Short Test

Method: using PPMU with VBT

 test is performed with protection diodes (to VDD and to GND). Usually use PPMU method with VBT code (also can be tested using PE and functional pattern).

Power Pin Short Test


Continuity test is to confirm the electronical contact between tester and DUT, and whether if short-circuit existed to other pins or to ground.


is a measurement of current from Device VDD pin with conditions more relaxed than those defined in the Device Specification.
