Digital to Analog Converter (ADC) is a device to converts a sequence of digital input data into analog signals.

Range of DAC output voltage between the minimum ($V_{ZS}$) and maximum ($V_{FS}$) analog outputs is called **Full Scale Range (FSR)**:

And average change in voltage when in between the input codes is defined as LSB:

$$
LSB=\frac{FSR_{measured}}{2^{bits}-1}
$$
