Mixed signal contains both analog and digital signals. Devices processing mixed signal typically include ADCs, DACs, analog switches and multiplexers, sample-and-hold amplifiers, and so on.

## Basic Glossary

- AWG(Arbitrary Waveform Generato): Low distortion signal generator.
- DSP:
  - Digital Signal Processor: A specialized device designed to process arrays rapidly, that are composed of digital representations of analog signals.
  - Digital Signal Processing: The process of analyzing sampled analog signal after it has been conberted into binary data.
- WD(Waveform Digitizer): Instrument that samples analog signals and converts them into digital values.
