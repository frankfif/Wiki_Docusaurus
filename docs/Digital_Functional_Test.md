## Troubleshooting of Digital Functional Debug

1. Reduce test frequency.
2. View the actual waveform, modify the position of comparison.
3. Repeat pattern lines for more times in prevent of the influence of setup time.
4. Use Shmoo method to analyze.
5. Switching the order of test execution, in prevent of the interaction between tests.
6. Pay attention to the Pin Electronic, Vt or?
7. Defects with pattern itself.
